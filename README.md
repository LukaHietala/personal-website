## [lukahietala.vercel.app](https://lukahietala.vercel.app)

This is the source code for my personal website that is in development at the moment and updated every now and then.

I built this website for myself to learn more about web development and to have a place to showcase my projects and blog posts, but you are welcome to take inspiration from it. And if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me on [Discord - Pix#3233](https://discord.com) (Note: I'm almost never on Discord, so it might take a while for me to respond).
